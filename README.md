# au-radio-affiliates

The purpose of this Shiny application is to visualize Auburn University sports radio affiliate locations. This is particularly valuable for one looking to find a radio station carrying an Auburn University athletic event if they are traveling and/or unfamiliar with local radio stations.

## Notes
There are some discrepancies between call signs, locations, and cities from the various sources. For example, the official Auburn Sports Network listing shows WSBM	1340 AM in Florence, AL as the only affiliate in the area, but this is in fact is duplicated with W250BY 97.9 FM in Florence. Because I know this, I corrected it. 

I could not find information on WHAL in Columbus, GA.
